1. maxsum_subarray.py
   Finds the sub-array with the maximum sum (> 0) within a given array.

2. sequence.c
   A C implementation of the look-and-say sequence
   ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence

3. pretty_print.py
   Finds words in a string that are present in a given word list. Chars in
   string that don't contribute to any word are replaced by '-'.
   Note: This is a greedy implementation that I'm not proud of.
         Suggestions for improvement are welcome.
